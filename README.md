# Rust Guessing Game 
## Learn Rust Basics by improving the game

Goal: Showcase various features of Rust by building and improvising the Guessing Game from Rust.
We start with the basic code from the **Rust Book** and add new data structures and functions to make the code modular and reusable.

Using `cargo search` to find the latest versions of the crates.
Crates are similar to packages in Java or modules in Python/Go.

* Use `cargo build` to build the code
* Use `cargo run` to run the code

**v1** - Version is straight copy from the Rust book.
User is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100.
If the guess is bigger than secret, it says _Too big!_ and it small says _Too small!_
